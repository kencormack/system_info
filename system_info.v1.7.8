# This script attempts to perform a fairly complete audit of the current
# configuration of a Raspberry Pi.  The target hardware is any variant or
# model of Pi, up to and including the Pi 4B in all it's available memory
# configurations (1-8GB).  Supported OS versions include Raspbian Stretch
# and Buster (including the newly renamed "Raspberry Pi OS", in 32-bit and
# 64-bit).  Expect things to not work on the 64-bit OS, while it is still
# beta.  No attempts will be made to back-port this to Jessie or older.
#
# The script is an "examination only" affair, making no attempts to add,
# delete, or change anything on the system.
#
# This script does not attempt to configure things for you, nor does it
# make any recommendations on config changes that should be made.  It ONLY
# reports what you currently have going on, with your system.  It is entirely
# YOUR responsibility to do the research needed, to properly set up your
# system.
#
# The intended audience for this script is any Pi user who wants to see how
# aspects of their Pi are currently equipped and configured, for general
# troubleshooting, confirmation, or education/curiosity purposes.  It does
# nothing that hasn't already been done by any/all of the tools it calls upon.
# I'm just consolidating everything into one place.  Deliberate attempts were
# made to make things easy to follow, and the coding style is meant for easy
# readability.
#
# 'sudo' access is required.  The script can be run as the user, and will
# call sudo only for those commands that need root privilege.
#
# The following packages are required, to do a basic inspection:
#   alsa-utils, bc, bluez, coreutils, cron, i2c-tools, initramfs-tools, iproute2,
#   util-linux, v4l-utils, libraspberrypi-bin, lshw, net-tools, procps, rpi-eeprom,
#   usbutils, sed, wireless-tools
#
# If the Pi being examined is a 4B, the package rpi-eeprom is also required.
#
# The script will explicitly test that each of those packages is installed.
# If any are missing, it will inform the user, and instruct them to install.
#
# The following supplemental packages may also be utilized:
#   at, cups-client, dc, docker-ce-cli, ethtool, hdparm, lirc, lm-sensors, lvm2,
#   m4, mdadm, nfs-kernel-server, nmap, perl-base, pigpiod, python3-gpiozero,
#   quota, rng-tools, rpcbind, rtl-sdr, samba, smartmontools, sysbench, sysstat,
#   systemd-container, systemd-coredump, watchdog, wiringpi, x11-xserver-utils
#
# NOTE:
# If you have a raspberry pi 4B (1/2/4GB only), install version 2.52 of wiringpi
# See - http://wiringpi.com/wiringpi-updated-to-2-52-for-the-raspberry-pi-4b/
# As WiringPi is now deprecated, this script will NOT support WiringPi on the
# Pi 4B 8GB model.
#
# The supplemental packages are not required, and the user will not be
# instructed to install them.  But they will be utilized if installed and
# configured.  Sections of the output made possible by the supplemental packages
# will bee marked with (***) in the heading of any sections involved, or in the
# part of an otherwise core test that has made use of the supplemental package.
#
# This script was tested on the following hardware:
#   hostname: pi-media (Ken's),
#   Pi 3B+ w/ Raspbian Stretch,
#   X150 9-port USB hub,
#   DVK512 board w/ RTC,
#   DockerPi Powerboard,
#   fit_StatUSB USB LED,
#   USB-attached 128GB SATA III SSD drive,
#   USB-attached 4TB Seagate hard drive,
#   HDMI Sony Flatscreen TV
#
#   hostname: pi-dev (Ken's),
#   Pi 4B (2G memory) w/ Raspbian Buster,
#   X150 9-port USB hub,
#   DVK512 board w/ RTC,
#   DockerPi Powerboard,
#   fit_StatUSB USB LED,
#   USB Bluetooth dongle (onboard BT disabled),
#   Hauppauge WinTV HVR950Q USB TV Tuner,
#   RTL-SDR USB Software Defined Radio,
#   X820 SATA III Board w/ 1TB SSD,
#   4K HDMI Display Emulator Dummy Plug (2 Ea.),
#   Headless - SSH and VNC only (No Display)
#
#   hostname: pi-devel-2GB (William's),
#   Pi 4B (2GB memory) w/ Raspbian Buster,
#   PiOled i2c display,
#   USB flash drive,
#   USB Ethernet adapter

  # Activity inverts the current state for a short period for every packet,

  # to tye Bluetooth module, while the mini UART is used as the primary
  # UART and will have a Linux console on it.  On all other models, the
  # PL011 is used as the primary UART.
  #
  # In Linux device terms, by default, /dev/ttyS0 refers to the mini UART,
  # and /dev/ttyAMA0 refers to the PL011.  The primary UART is the one
  # assigned to the Linux Console, which depends on the Raspberry Pi model
  # as described above.  There are also symlinksi: /dev/serial0, which
  # always refers to the primary UART (if enabled), and /dev/serial1,
  # which similarly always refers to the secondary UART (if enabled.)
  #
  # The Pi 4 allows up to 4 additional hardware UARTS (2 thru 5) to be defined.
  # uart2 uses pins that could conflict with the camera and any kind of "hat" with eerom.
  #   Also If you enable the handshake, I2C1 has to be disabled.
  # uart3 use GPIO4 then you should consider to change 1 wire GPIO pin if you need 1 wire.
  #   It also uses GPIO7 if you enable handshake then you need to disable SPI.
  # uart4 uses the SPI GPIOs.  SPI needs to be disabled.
  # No conflict with uart5. This is the safest one to use.

  # IN OTHER WORDS:
  # On all Pis, UART0 is a PL011 that appear to Linux as ttyAMA<n>,
  # and UART1 is an 8250 clone that appears as ttyS0.  On a Pi4,
  # UART2-5 are additional PL011s that also appear as ttyAMA<n>.
  # The number starts at 0 for the first enabled PL011 and counts
  # up through all the enabled interfaces.  The numbering is stable
  # for any given combination of UARTs, but enabling or disabling
  # one can change the number assignments of others.
  #
  # Adding "enable_uart=1" to config.txt on a Pi4 enables ttyS0 (UART1)
  # on GPIOs 14 & 15 (Alt5), leaving UART0 driving the Bluetooth
  # interface on 30-33 (Alt3).  Adding "dtoverlay=disable-bt" switches
  # the UART roles so that UART0 is mapped to 14 & 15 (Alt0), leaving
  # UART1 unmapped.
